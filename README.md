# MyReads Project

In this project, I have created a bookshelf appliction that allows user to select and categorize books they have read, are currently reading, or want to read.
The project emphasizes using React to build the application. It uses the provided API server and client library that I used to persist information as I interact with the application.

I started this project with the starter code provided and added interactivity to the app by refactoring the static code in the template.
